# KxHTTP

A fast, open-source and minimal HTTP client for quick and easy API testing.

## Getting Started

You can build and run KxHTTP from the source by cloning this repo and running
the build script suitable for your platform located in the "scripts" folder. You may
need to modify the scripts in accordance with your environment.

Alternatively, you can head over to [kxhttp.org/downloads](https://kxhttp.org/downloads) to download 
installers. At the moment I've only built a Windows installer, other installers 
will be available soon.
